# Thirty Days. Thirty Problems. Thirty Practical Solutions.

## Introduction
Project Thirty is a personal initiative where I solve one real world business problem every day for thirty days. The goal is not to write code for the sake of code. The goal is to think like someone who belongs inside a strong team. Someone who can take an ambiguous problem, understand the business impact, design a structured approach, and deliver a usable solution.
This challenge brings together the skills I care about most
problem solving
strategic thinking
project management
clear communication
data driven validation
continuous learning
Every problem I pick is the kind of challenge that real teams face across fintech, consulting, operations, strategy, and product management. Each day follows the same core structure
What is the business problem
Why does it matter
Who does it impact
What questions do we need to answer
What approach makes sense
What is the outcome or recommendation
Some solutions require analytics.
Some require reasoning, planning, prioritisation, or risk assessment.
Some require forecasting or modelling.
Some require creating a process that teams can follow.
The focus is not on the tool, but on the thinking behind the solution.
This series is mainly about improving how I analyse, how I plan, and how I communicate.
My goal is to become the type of person who does not wait for instructions, but who takes initiative, breaks down complexity, and adds clarity wherever something is unclear. A person who thinks in terms of impact, feasibility, constraints, stakeholders, timelines, and execution.
At the end of thirty days I want a portfolio that shows not just technical skills, but judgment, reasoning, and the ability to solve problems that actually matter to a business.

# ⭐ Why I Created Project Thirty
Business problems rarely come with clean instructions.
They require understanding, structure, and ownership.
Through this challenge, I want to strengthen my ability to handle ambiguous situations, identify root causes, define clear problem statements, plan and prioritise solutions, make data informed decisions, communicate insights in a way executives can act on. These are the skills that make a strong PM, analyst, strategist, or operator. These are the skills I want to practice every single day.

# ⭐ Final Note
This challenge is not about perfection.
It is about consistency, clarity, and growth.
One problem at a time.
One solution at a time.
Thirty days straight.
